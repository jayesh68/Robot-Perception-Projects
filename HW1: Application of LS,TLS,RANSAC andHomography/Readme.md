1.The python code to run problem2 is HW1_P2.py.

2.The python ocde to run problem3 is HW1_P3.py.

3.The PDF file containing the solution for problem 1 and the explainations for problem 2 and 3 is JAYESH_ENPM673_HW1.pdf.


HW1_P2.py consists of the code to run the least squares, TLS and RANSAC method. This would create 2 subplots for the two videos with all the 3 methods being plotted for each video.

HW1_P3.py consists of the code to run problem 3 which is used to determine the homography matrix after computing the SVD
